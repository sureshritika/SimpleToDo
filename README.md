## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I have previous experience with Android Studio so using the actual software was fairly easy for me once I got the hang of it again. The challenge that I had was using Kotlin for the first time rather than Java which I have prior experience with and figuring out how to work with a new language and its syntax.
